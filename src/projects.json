It supports hundreds of simultaneous games and real-time client-server communication through WebSocket. The project was originally written without a JavaScript framework, but to improve the quality of both the code and the final product, we elected to completely rewrite the project from scratch using React. I mainly developed the front-end while my friend handled the server, but neither exclusively.",
