<h1 align="center">Portfolio and Blog</h1>

This is the repository for my portfolio and blog, created using Gatsby. You can find a production build on Cloudflare Pages at [whenderson.dev](https://whenderson.dev). Project content is stored in the [`projects.json`](https://github.com/w-henderson/Portfolio/blob/master/src/projects.json) file to make it easier to maintain, and images are stored in the static files directory. Blog posts are stored in the [`blog`](https://github.com/w-henderson/Portfolio/tree/master/blog) folder using Markdown. You can read a blog post about how I built the blog [here](https://whenderson.dev/blog/creating-a-blog-with-gatsby).
