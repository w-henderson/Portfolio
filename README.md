This is the repository for my portfolio, created using Gatsby. You can find a production build on Cloudflare Pages at [whenderson.dev](https://whenderson.dev). Content is stored in the [`projects.json`](https://github.com/w-henderson/Portfolio/blob/master/src/projects.json) file to make it easier to maintain, and images are stored in the static files directory.
